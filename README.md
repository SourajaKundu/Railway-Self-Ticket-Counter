# Railway-Self-Ticket-Counter
This project was inspired by my recent experience of buying tickets for JR (Japanese Railway) line trains with JPY coins. The Railway Ticket Counter project aims to design and implement a ticket vending machine for railway tickets. The system provides a user-friendly interface for customers to select their destinations and purchase tickets conveniently. It incorporates various features such as multiple destinations, varying ticket prices based on distance, and coin-based payment.
